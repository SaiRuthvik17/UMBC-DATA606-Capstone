### Projects

#### Movie Box Office Success Prediction | 02/2021 - 04/2021

Constructed a model that forecasts a movieâ€™s success by considering revenue as the dependent variable. Led a team of five wherein we performed explanatory data analysis, feature selection & modeling. We were able to achieve an accuracy of 85% by fine-tuning the model with hyperparameter tuning.

#### Movie Recommender System | 03/2023 - 05/2023

Analyzed data of over 10000 movies with its different attributes and performed exploratory data analysis to obtain valuable insights about relationship between various movies by using Numpy and Pandas. Used context based filtering to match the similar kinds of movies based on the features of the movies. Also used collaborative based filtering to get the user point of view to make the recommendation more the model more accurate. 

#### Cricket Match Analysis and Prediction | 04/2023 - 05/2023

Led an in-depth data analysis on a 14-year cricket match data using Spark and Pandas. Conducted advanced data manipulation, exploratory analysis, and developed predictive models using machine learning algorithms. Extracted valuable insights for strategic decision-making, bridging sports analytics with data-driven management.

#### Classification of digits using MNIST Dataset | 10/2023 - 11/2023

Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using NumPy to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Implemented forward and backward passes for custom layers including convolutional, max pooling, ReLU activations, and fully connected layers. Achieved a test accuracy over 95% on the MNIST test set through training over 60000 images across 10 digit classes.
